# About Me

I have been doing security assessments over the last few years to a wide variety of envirements from web applications to mobile applications and internal networks.
More recentely I also started working on hardware hacking where I have been doing assessments to routers, RDK set-top-boxes, Android set-top-boxes and even EV charging stations in order to help clients find and mitigate vulnereabilities and thus securing their devices.
<br>

I also work with develpment teams by reviewing software requirements and performing code analysis and penetration testing as well as reviewing and fine tuning the CICD process in order to ensure a secure development lifecycle.
I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and i am currentely finishing my master's degree thesis on reverse engineering and binary patching, and I have CEH, OSCP and OSWE certifications.
<br>

My main programming language is Python although i am also very familiar with JAVA, C and assembly.

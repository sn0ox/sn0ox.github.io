Over the last few years, I have been conducting security assessments on a wide variety of environments, from web applications to mobile applications and internal networks. Most recently, I have also started working on hardware hacking, where I have been conducting assessments on routers, RDK set-top boxes, Android set-top boxes, and even EV charging stations in order to help clients find and mitigate vulnerabilities and thus secure their devices.

I also worked with development teams to ensure a secure development lifecycle by reviewing software requirements, performing code analysis and penetration testing, and reviewing and fine-tuning the CICD process. Currently, I work as a vulnerability researcher a Bitsight.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Cyber Security, with a dissertation focused on [reverse engineering and binary patching]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/58214)). I also have CEH, OSCP, OSWP, and OSWE certifications.<br>
<br>

My main programming language is Python, although I am also very familiar with JAVA, C and assembly.
